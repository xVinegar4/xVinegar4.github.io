I was born when the worst of me was over
Even though you took the best of me
I always idealized love as two people split by a wall
The pale zone is cold and one of them has a coat
The wall's made of thorns and they can't see each other at all

One or both come and touch
The thorns can hurt them or make them feel anonymous as they bleed from their fingerprints
Like something's pulling them, like magnets
One or both come and touch
They face all and feel no one

As they step in, one realizes they're both bare
Found the coat decides to dare
Steps in, cuts himself, cries, feels lonely or happy he doesn't care

One or both come and touch
The thorns hurt them and made them feel anonymous as they bled from their fingerprints
Like something's guided them and made them collide
One and both come and touch
They reach each other and feel someone

I used to have this all.
I mean, in my earphones
It's funny to think about the things that can happen
In one year, in one ear and then your mind
Writing songs as a way to cope with all
Imagine blinded beings, a coat and a wall
