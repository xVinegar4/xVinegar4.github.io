Waking up next to my phone
Feeling sick, Sunday sadness, I’m feeling exhausted
And now I’m dreaming, when will I see you again?
I think about you, I like you and I’ll be lost in your hairs
Dreaming up about how I’m not alone
I have someone to think about while I crack my backbone
We said each other we like the way we are
I think we could be the cure to each other scars

You think that I’m not what I am showing to you
It’s just I’m not who I am, I don’t know, you should ask my crew
And I don’t care if you think I wanna fuck or just talk
Just born again to replace__ The place you’ll leave when you’ll need your own space

We’re feeling loved while we’re writing through these sheets
But I hear my phone blinking, at least you texted me
You say the same old shits when you don’t wanna jump
And I reply the same old shits when I don’t want to scream
Now I’m calm, I’m not used to scream and cry
I’m not used to beg and ask if she wants to stay
I can’t put my hands around someone else’s neck
I'm not used to beg to have someone else back

You said the same old shits when you don’t wanna jump
Now I replied the same old shits when I don’t wanna scream
You said the same old shits when you don’t wanna jump
Now I replied the same old shits when I don’t wanna scream

I said I loved cause it’s so while you’re leaving me for text
I’m still sad cause I had it all for planned
Whatever now I don’t care, just don’t fuck with my friends
I said it all about me and how I had it all planned
I think I’ll do it all without you, just don’t fuck with my friends
Don’t fuck with my friends
Don’t fuck with my friends
I think I’ll do that without you, now i have it all planned
At least I think about this and not you while you fuck with my__ friends.
