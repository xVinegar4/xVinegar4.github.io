My bass stands on her heart, against her legs, on the floor
She pushed me to her face, I said our life's gonna change
She pushed me to her face, a portal for different time and space  
I showed her the scars that I collected on my sheets
Songs on the ones I left behind
Or just things I must remember and fragmented parts of mind

She swore to know the 'right' for me
And after that she walked away
I was younger then, yeah young and free
I was fighting fire to make peace with me

She took some steps and stopped
The turned around and looked]
Me in the eyes told me she loved me
Pulled out my heart and laughed above me
