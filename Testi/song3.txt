My bass stands on her heart
Against her legs, on the floor
She pushed me to her face
A portal for different time 
And space  

I showed her the scars that I 
Collected on my sheets
Songs on the ones I left behind
Or just things I must remember 
Fragmented parts of mind

She swore to know the 'right' for me
And after that she walked away
I was younger then, yeah young and free
I was fighting fire to make peace with me

She took some steps and stopped
The turned around and looked]
Me in the eyes told me she loved me
Pulled out my heart and laughed above me

We always fight to be free
And cry to find what we can't see
We always find the same fears
For all our years
Fill up songs with things we can't explain
We strive to tie us down 
With the same old chain


I showed her the scars that I 
Collected on my sheets
Songs on the ones I left behind
Or just things I must remember 
Fragmented parts of mind
